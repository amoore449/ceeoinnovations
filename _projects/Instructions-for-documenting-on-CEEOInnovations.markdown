# The CEEO Portfolio
## CEEO innovations is a hub for the the CEEO's work
CEEO innovations is a “hub” for all the cool projects going on at the CEEO. “Projects” pages on the site like the one you will make 
will let visitors learn about specific projects going  at the CEEO.
*Think of your page as an “advertisement” or summary of your project.*
</div>

<!--FREE WRITE lets you write any markdown you want (include images, lists, titles, code,etc)
               If something doesn't look how you expect on the page, try adding a linebreak after it--------------------->

# Before you start documenting...
## make sure you have

- A few sentences or paragraphs of content summarizing the project 
- At least 2-5 images (give them easy to type names) saved to a folder on your computer
- *This includes a “display” cropped 2:3*

### Optional but not required:

- Any relevant documents or pdfs
- Any relevant videos
- Links to related sites so people can learn more about the project

# Creating a Page
1. Use Drag and Drop to upload a folder of images and documents for your page to project assets 
2. Go into the _projects folder and copy the SAMPLE-FILE.markdown to make a new file for your page. Title it how you want your page to appear with “-” dashes instead of spaces
3. Customize the sample file with divs and markdown to display the content you want.
4. Commit your file and check that it looks how you want it to by refreshing the site (github takes a few minutes to update, you can make this faster by using incognito).
Done!
