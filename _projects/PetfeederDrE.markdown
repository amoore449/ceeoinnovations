Design process:

This pet feeder was easy to create. It consists of a simple structure to hold one motor, a small platform to hold the treat, a ramp for the treat to roll down, and a button for the pet to press.

When the pet presses the button, the motor rotates, tipping the platform that holds the treat until it rolls down the ramp.
